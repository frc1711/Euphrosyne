# 2022-TestBot 
A repo to test the 2022 WPIlib and our swervelib on a very basic test bot that the swerve drive has been mounted on.

## When making changes/updates/improvements.
Please create your changes in a branch other then the main line Development branch, and do a PR to merge your commits back in.  Kind of like creating this readme.md file.  This will it's own branch, and then using a PR merge it into the base repo.
